### Project Objective 

  Autonomous robots are robots that are capable of making real-time decisions based on
the data they retrieve from the environment. These robots can be used for a variety of
applications that serve a useful purpose. The Roomba is a popular brand of autonomous robots
whose purpose is to vacuum floors in a house. These robots are equipped with infrared sensors
that can detect obstacles in close proximity [1]. Using these sensors they can navigate around a
house while avoiding obstacles or getting stuck. This exemplifies how a robot can make
decisions to serve a useful purpose. Similar to the Roomba, this project will focus on building a
robot that will need to make navigation decisions while fulfilling a purpose.
The goal for this project is to design and build a snow removal robot using the
CoppelliaSim environment that is capable of clearing as much snow as possible in an enclosed
area. Our team name is Neon Carrot.
