Vision sensors, which are viewable objects, will be used to render the path objects in the field of view and trigger detection when robot reaches the black path. 
Vision sensors were chosen over proximity sensors for the black path detection as color plays a role in the detection process, which favors vision sensor’s ability. 
The vision sensor’s image content will be accessed via the API to route the robot back in the path scene when on the black path region.

Proximity sensors would be used for obstacle detection to allow for the distinguishing of snow entities. 
Proximity sensors were chosen over vision sensors due to the functionality that allows for the detection of detectable entities (snow). 
The sensor’s detection functionality will be used in accordance with the snow plow to clear snow off path.
